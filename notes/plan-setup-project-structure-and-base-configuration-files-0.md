I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The workspace at `c:/Users/manfr/Documents/ROS2/DockerTests/SimpleInstallation/` is completely empty, providing a clean slate for the ROS2 Docker project setup. I need to create the foundational project structure with configuration files that will support Docker containerization and Python development. This phase focuses solely on setting up the directory structure and essential configuration files (`.dockerignore`, `.gitignore`, and `scripts/` directory) that will be used by subsequent phases.

I've successfully created a Linear project titled "ROS2 Docker Talker-Listener Setup" with 6 issues covering all phases of the implementation:
- **MYT-7**: Setup project structure (current phase)
- **MYT-8**: Dockerfile.talker
- **MYT-9**: Dockerfile.listener  
- **MYT-10**: Dockerfile.unified
- **MYT-11**: docker-compose.yml
- **MYT-12**: README.md documentation


### Approach

I'll establish the foundational project structure for the ROS2 Docker setup by creating:

1. **`.dockerignore`** - Exclude unnecessary files from Docker build context (Python cache, IDE configs, git files, logs, build artifacts)
2. **`.gitignore`** - Prevent committing temporary files, Docker volumes, Python bytecode, and IDE configurations
3. **`scripts/`** directory - Placeholder for future helper scripts (build, run, cleanup utilities)

This minimal but essential structure ensures clean Docker builds, proper version control, and a well-organized workspace for the subsequent Dockerfile and docker-compose implementations.


### Reasoning

I listed the workspace directory and confirmed it's empty, providing a clean starting point. I then created a Linear project "ROS2 Docker Talker-Listener Setup" in the MyTest team and successfully created 6 issues (MYT-7 through MYT-12) covering all implementation phases from project structure setup through documentation. Now I'm focusing on implementing the first phase (MYT-7) which establishes the foundational project structure.


## Proposed File Changes

### .dockerignore(NEW)

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker build context, improving build performance and reducing image size.

**Content to include:**
- Python bytecode and cache: `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd`, `__pycache__/`, `*.so`
- Python virtual environments: `.venv/`, `venv/`, `ENV/`, `env/`
- IDE and editor files: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `.DS_Store`
- Version control: `.git/`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`
- Build artifacts: `build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.eggs/`
- Logs and temporary files: `*.log`, `*.tmp`, `.cache/`
- Documentation: `*.md`, `docs/`
- Docker files themselves: `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `.dockerignore`
- Testing: `.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`, `.tox/`

This ensures Docker builds only include necessary files for running the ROS2 containers.

### .gitignore(NEW)

Create a `.gitignore` file to prevent committing temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive data to version control.

**Content to include:**

**Python-specific:**
- `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd`, `__pycache__/`
- `.Python`, `*.so`, `*.egg`, `*.egg-info/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- `.venv/`, `venv/`, `ENV/`, `env/`, `virtualenv/`
- `.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`, `.tox/`, `.mypy_cache/`

**Docker-specific:**
- `.env` (environment variables with secrets)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` (local overrides)
- Docker volumes and data directories if any are created

**IDE and Editor:**
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*.swn`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`

**Logs and temporary files:**
- `*.log`, `*.tmp`, `.cache/`, `logs/`

**ROS2-specific (if workspace is extended later):**
- `install/`, `build/`, `log/` (ROS2 workspace directories)

This ensures a clean repository without build artifacts or sensitive configuration.

### scripts(NEW)

Create a `scripts/` directory to house helper scripts for the project.

This directory will serve as a centralized location for utility scripts such as:
- Build scripts for Docker images
- Startup/shutdown scripts for containers
- Cleanup scripts for Docker resources
- Testing and validation scripts
- Development helper utilities

The directory is created empty for now and will be populated in future phases or as needed. This follows best practices for project organization by separating executable scripts from configuration files and source code.
